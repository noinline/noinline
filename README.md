## Hello world! (*so silly*)

<p align="left"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=noinline&label=visitors&color=d8caac&style=flat" alt="noinline" /> </p>

I'm a programmer with decent amount of knowledge in *C++*, most familliar with reverse-engineering projects and cheating software. I work on both *Windows* and *Linux*, and had experience using *ImGui*, *Minhook* and *SourceSDK*.

Currently, I'm interested in:
- Learning WINAPI internals;
- Programming for desktop Linux;
- Low-level reverse engineering.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in exploiting game engines for fun or just texting :3c
