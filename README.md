I'm a strange *C++* programming freak, obsessed with not less stranger useless
projects, reverse-engineering and cheating software. I work on both *Windows*
and *Linux*, and had experience using *ImGui*, *Minhook* and *SourceSDK*.

Currently, I'm into:
- Unholy C;
- Learning FASM, Linux Kernel and Win32 API;
- Low-level reverse engineering.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in exploiting game engines for fun
or just texting :3
