I'm a strange *C++* programming freak, obsessed with not less stranger useless  
projects, reverse-engineering and mainly cheating software. I really like  
being online, anyways here's Wonderwall:

Today is gonna be the day  
That they're gonna throw it back to you  
By now, you should've somehow  
Realised what you gotta do  
I don't believe that anybody  
Feels the way I do about you now  

Backbeat, the word is on the street  
That the fire in your heart is out  
I'm sure you've heard it all before  
But you never really had a doubt  
I don't believe that anybody  
Feels the way I do about you now  

And all the roads we have to walk are winding  
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding  
There are many things that I would like to say to you  
But I don't know how  

Because maybe  
You're gonna be the one that saves me  
And after all  
You're my wonderwall.  

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in exploiting game engines for fun  
or just texting :3
